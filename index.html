        <p>A defining principle of this project was established during Warden Alwis' tenure: the <strong>Main Quadrangle is sacred</strong>. [cite_start]To honor our heritage, it was mandated that no new additions to the campus should be visible from that hallowed space[cite: 80, 81, 89].</p>
        
        <div class="img-placeholder">
            [IMAGE: View of the Main Quadrangle showing how the new Senior Block remains hidden from view]
        </div>

        [cite_start]<p>Every new edifice is designed to be subservient to the main space[cite: 81]. [cite_start]This led to innovative solutions, such as cutting into the ground to the level of the dining hall for the Commerce Block, ensuring the building height respected the college’s historic aesthetic[cite: 92, 94].</p>

            [cite_start]<p>The concept of the Senior Quadrangle was born from early dialogues that challenged the boundaries of traditional education while respecting the roots of the school[cite: 85].</p>

        [cite_start]<p>The **Gnanam Foundation** undertook the total cost for Stage I in memory of the founder of the Gnanam empire, following a personal request from Warden de Soysa to his classmate[cite: 87, 88]. [cite_start]Today, Stages I, II, and III are fully completed and occupied, standing as a living legacy of this generosity[cite: 109, 110].</p>

                    [cite_start]<p>Environmental preservation was key: during construction, the existing <strong>Beli tree</strong> was saved, and the <strong>old well</strong> was reinforced and secured as a historical feature[cite: 99, 127].</p>
